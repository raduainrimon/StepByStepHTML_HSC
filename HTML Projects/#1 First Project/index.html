    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that
        web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
        (not a programming language).</b

      <b
        >HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.</b

    </p>

    <p><b>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts: </b></p>

    <ol type="a" start="5">
      <li><strong>The opening tag</strong></li>
      <li><strong>The closing tag</strong></li>
      <li><strong>The actual element</strong></li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
