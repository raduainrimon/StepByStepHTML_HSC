/*
- THE RGB MODEL: Every color can be represented by a combination of
RED, GREEN, and BLUE.
- Each of the 3 base colors can take a value between 0 and 255,
which leads to 16.8 million different colors.

- Defining colors in css
(1)
ðŸ‘‰ RGB/ RGBA Notation: Regular RGB Notation rgb(0,255,255), rgb(244,179,63)
ðŸ‘‰ RGB with transparency ("alpha"): rgb(0,255,255,0.3), rgb(244,179,63,0.7)

(2) Hexadecimal Notation
ðŸ‘‰ instead of using a scale from 0 to 255, we go from 0 to ff(255 in hexadecimal numbers)
#00ffff
ðŸ‘‰ shorthand, when all colors are identical pairs
#0ff


ðŸ˜‰ In practice, we mostly use hexadecimal colors, and rgba when we need transparency
